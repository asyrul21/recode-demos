# Command Line Basics

For this demo, we will go over the 12 essential linux commands that I use almost everyday in my professional career as a software engineer. The command line used to be the primary interface between a user and a computer. Nothing a person can do on a GUI, which cannot be done on the command line.

Knowing these commands also help you particularly if you will be joining our Beginner Python Programming Masterclass on the 17th February.

_IMPORTANT NOTE_

If you are using MacOS or Linux, these commands are the same. However, if you use Windows, the commands are different. In this demo we'll go through only the linux commands, but you can try out the windows commands yourself.

Also, in Windows, directory slashes "/" are backwards "\\". Example

macOS/Linux: Documents/Development/RecodeMasterclass/Demos

Windows: Documents\\Development\\RecodeMasterclass\\Demos

## Commands (macOS,Linux/Windows)

Break those commands intro 3 categories:

1. Navigational
2. File Manipulation
3. File READ/WRITE
4. Others

### Navigation Commands - _MOST IMPORTANT_

1. pwd / cd

- Show current directory

2. ls / dir

- show list of files in current directory

3. cd \_ / cd \_

- traverse into or out of a folder

### File Manipulation Commands

4. mkdir / mkdir

- create a folder

5. touch / call >>

- create a file

6. rm / del, rm -rf / deltree

- delete file, folder

7. mv / move

- move or rename a file

8. cp / copy

- copy files over

### File READ/WRITE Commands

8. cat / type

- view the file

9. nano / - (could be configured using WSL (Windows Sub System))

- edit the file

### Other

10. man / help

- show manual or help

11. clear / cls

- clear the command line screen

12. Running and application - same for both - _IMPORTANT_

    Must:

    - must be in same directory
    - language libraries must be installed

    Examples:

    - python [filename]
    - node [filename]
